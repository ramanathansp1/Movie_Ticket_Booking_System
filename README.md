# Movie_Ticket_Booking_System

Hello People!
I'm Very excited to share my first OOPS project based on Movie Ticket Booking System.
It's a console based project with database as MYSQL!
It basically has Admin ,who can add Movies,remove movies, and check for the people who had booked tickets in his Theatre!
It also has provisions to add total number of seats for a particular show!
He can also add the price for every show!
We can both signup and login with the  Admin.
Once we signup with the admin, it automatically allocates the Theatre Name at required places, without admin intervention!

Secondly, there is User, who can do both Operations of Signup and Login!
He has access to search movies based on Movie name!
He can also search Movies based on Theatre Name!
Or else he can also has ability to view All the Shows in his Surroundings!
He can Book tickets based on his interest and he also has the ability to finally view all the tickets booked by him!
He will also be displayed the price of the ticket at the final booking step!
If the no.of seats are less than the need ,then it is handled effectively!
There cannot be duplicate Movie entries!
Password Strongness is checked while signup process!

You need to create Four tables in SQL:
1)Admin
2)User
3)Movies
4)Bookings
Those description of table, I will add as image!

If you create those tables in MySQL and download this project, you can successfully run this project in your Machine!
You must also check for the SQl.java file for proper jdbc connection according to your system!

Everything is clearly coded up and all comments are welcome!
Hope there's more things to Learn!
Happy Coding!
